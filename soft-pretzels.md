Soft Pretzels

Twenty years ago, my friend Molly gave me a recipe for soft pretzels which we made one weekend afternoon. 
Ever since then, I have used no other recipe for making pretzels.

3 dozen 6-inch Sticks or Twelve 6-inch Pretzels

<pre>
Combine in a mixer bowl:

1 cup 105-115(degree) water
1 package active dry yeast (2.5tsps)

when dissolved, add and beat at least 3 minutes:

1&1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour

when dissolved, add and beat at least 3 minutes:
1&1/2 cups sifted all-purpose flour
2 tablespoons soft butter
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar.

stir in:
1 & 1/4 cups sifted all-purpse flour

and knead until the dough loses its stickiness.

Let rise in a covered greased bowl until doubled in bulk.

Punch down and divide into 12 pieces for pretzels or 36 smaller pieces for sticks. 
With your palms, roll the 12 pretzel pieces into 18-inch lengths, about pencil thickness, tapering the ends slightly. 
Loop into a pretzel shape. Place on a greased baking sheet and let rise until almost doubled in bulk.

Preheat oven to 475 (F).

Have ready a boiling solution of:
8 cups water
3 tbs baking soda.

Do not use an aluminum pan for this mixture.

With a slotted spoon, carefully lower the pretzels into the water about 1 minute or until they float to the top. Return them to the greased sheet.

Sprinkle with: coarse salt

Bake until crispy and browned, about 12 minutes for the pretzels, less for the sticks.

Note:
They are best served at once, but will keep about one week in an airtight container.
