CHALLAH

5 lbs bread flour
2 yarzeit glasses of sugar (=2 cups)
1 1/2 tbs. salt
4 tbs. instant yeast

Mix all above ingredients

Add

5 eggs
1 cup oil
about 4 cups water

Combine and then knead until you think your arms are going to fall off and then knead some more. 
The dough should be very elastic and even a bit sticky.

Clean mixing bowl and spray with PAM.


Place in covered bowl,  make sure dough has PAM coating on it.and allow to rise about 1 1/2 to 2 hours

Punch down and knead again then return to covered bowl, allow to rise as in the step above.

Form into challahs, i.e., braid (I use a six strand braid most of the time). Challah are usually baked free form, i.e., not in a pan. 
Coat challah with egg wash (one beaten egg with 2 tsp water), Allow challah to proof uncovered. 
Amount of time can vary from 45 minutes to 1 1/2 hours, depends on room temperature.

Preheat oven to 350F.

Coat challahs again with egg wash and use poppy seeds if desired.

Bake for 35 to 60 minutes, depends on your oven and challah size.

These days I rarely make the 5 pound variety. So below is the change for using 2 1/2 pound of flour.

Divide ingredients by two, but use three eggs.
