INGREDIENTS
670 grams high-gluten or bread flour
354 grams ice cold water
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon malt powder
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
lye (weigh and scale proportionally to water)

Makes 8 bagels. A kitchen scale is required. This dough is VERY tough. If the stand mixer struggles, turn it off and let the 
dough relax for about 10 minutes, then try kneading again. 

In summary, knead the dough until it passes the windowpane test, shape the bagels and allow to retard overnight. Next morning, 
boil the bagels and bake them.

1. Add flour to stand mixer bowl. In a cup, add the cold water, malt powder and yeast and stir to combine. Start mixer on low
speed and slowly add the water mixture to the flour.  
 
Knead with dough hook for about 15 minutes, then add the salt and allow it to evenly distribute. Then do the windowpane test to
check whether the gluten has formed: take a golfball-sized chunk of dough and stretch it into a thin membrane. If you can see 
light shine through the membrane and the dough doesn't break when stretched, the dough has passed the windowpane test and 
ready for the next step.

2. Chop the dough into eight 4.5-oz pieces. Shape dough into bagels and place on cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.
Immediately cover with plastic wrap and transfer to refrigerator for overnight retardation. 

3. The next morning, preheat the oven to 450 degrees (use convection setting if you have it). Weigh a pot of water. WEARING
PROTECTIVE GLASSES AND GLOVES, weigh the lye so that it accounts for 0.15% of the water - e.g. if you have 2200 grams of water,
add 3 grams of lye into the water. ADD LYE TO POT OF WATER BEFORE BRINGING THE WATER TO A BOIL. Remove bagels from refrigerator
and boil in water - 30 seconds on each side. 

4. Transfer boiled bagels to a cooling rack to drain them for a few minutes. Coat bagels with toppings of your choice. Transfer 
coated bagels to baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Transfer cookie sheet with bagels to hot oven.

5. Bake for 10 minutes, then flip the bagels and bake for another 5 minutes and check for brownness. Once the bagels have 
achieved a golden brown crust, you can remove them and let cool on cooling rack.
